Selecting "Presentation Mode" from the Action menu will hide the file list pane and editor pane, displaying only the preview pane in spread mode.

## Auto Reload

By default, "Auto Reload" in the Action menu is checked. This automatically reloads the file and redraws the preview when the file is changed.

If you want to focus on writing or other tasks, you can uncheck "Auto Reload" by selecting it again. If reloading is needed, select "Auto Reload" again to check it (it acts as a toggle switch).

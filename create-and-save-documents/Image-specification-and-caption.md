    - The image formats that can be decoded are only jpeg and png.

4. Return to the “Upload File” window. Confirm that the file name of the selected image file is entered, then click the “Upload” button (red circle).

7. The link to the image file has been pasted into the editor screen (red line). However, it seems that the image is not reflected in the preview pane. This is because the display size of the image is too large and is displayed on the next page (a button to turn to the next page, which was not there before, has appeared on the right side of the preview pane). The image has added one more page. Let's make the image smaller and fit it on one page. Also, add an appropriate caption for the photo.

8. Following the link to the image file that was pasted earlier (red line), specify the size using HTML notation within `{  }`. On the other hand, the caption is within `[  ]`, initially containing the file name. Rewrite it to any string you like.

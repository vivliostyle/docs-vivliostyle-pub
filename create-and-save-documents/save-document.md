# Editing and Saving Documents

1. This is the state before editing. As you can see from the preview, the notation for ruby is incorrect, such as placing `|` in inappropriate places and using full-width `｛｝`. Let's fix it.

2. Editing is complete. When you check the preview, the ruby is properly formatted. Press the `Save document` button (red circle) to save. Before saving, the text inside the button is black, indicating that it can be pressed.

3. When you change the document, the text inside the `Save document` button (red circle) automatically grays out, indicating that it cannot be pressed. Additionally, a message notifying you of the save appears at the bottom of the screen.
